# TITOMADANIELPLATA
This repository will be used for the second part of the titoma cathedra

First, I want to present myself, I am Daniel Plata and i want to form part of the titoma family. In this project I am going to make a system for sensor the emperature and humidity in a coffee's farm. So, I have to choose the MCU that is going to do this task without wasting money. The objetive of this idea is to provide a helpful hand to colombian farmers, in order to make their work easier.
